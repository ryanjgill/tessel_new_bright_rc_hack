# Tessel 2 New Bright RC Hack
Using a Tessel 2 to replace the internals of the new bright rc car and control it using websockets.

### This will use 4 digital pins on the tessel to control 2 dc motors. 
I connected 2 pins for each motor to an H bridge and use the tessel to control the flow of current based on each pin's value.
